    <h2>Our story</h2>
    <p>It all started with a painter, a singer, a garage, and a dream.<br>In 2015, two art school graduates from UW-Green Bay decided to open a studio space in their garage for the local art department and casually offered hot beverages for the working students.<br>Here at the Loose Leaf Cafe, we continue to serve local creatives and offer a safe and relaxing environment to the community.</p>
