        <p>My favorite things are my family, my cat, traveling, and making stuff. My family lives in Green Bay, Wisconsin and I like to visit them during school breaks. My cat's name is Phoebe who is a lovable diva. I like the fine arts like drawing and painting but I also like crafting things like sewing and crocheting.</p>
